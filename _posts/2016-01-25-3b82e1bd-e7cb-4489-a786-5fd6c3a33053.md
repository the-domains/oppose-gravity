What you will learn-

**Movement Foundations** is a break from traditional fitness and other health related exercise. Based around the concept of **"Movement is Medicine,"** the focus of muscle development is second to strengthening the weakest links within the human system, your connective tissues! Strengthening and extending the range of motion at the joint capsule allows the body to reach its full potential for force production and lessen the chance of injury. Most injuries occur in or around the joint capsule where most of us never place much thought unless you injure yourself. Countless programs jump right into strengthening muscle tissue for growth and performance neglecting the connective tissues that support these systems. 

**Tissue damage occurs when applied load/stress exceeds the load bearing capacity of the tissue**. Oppose Gravity's Movement Foundations program will focus on range of motion and strength development of the joint capsule first. 

**47% of stiffness occurs in the joint itself**, followed by the muscles fascia at 41%, the tendons at 10%, and skin at 2%.So by working from joints outward the entire system will grow stronger in the process. This is accomplished by moving the joints themselves in various ranges of motion under various loads and or tension. As the joints become more resilient increasingly more difficult movements will be introduced to teach the nervous system how to control larger deeper ranges of active mobility. 

Using guided progressions from gymnastics, dance, martial arts and other movement based techniques this program will seek to improve the human system by allowing you to move how you are designed to! 

**JUMP, RUN, CRAWL, PUSH, PULL, CLIMB, BEAR AND LIFT WEIGHT. **
