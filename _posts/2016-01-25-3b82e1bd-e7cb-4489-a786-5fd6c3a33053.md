Challenge life! Your body your rules transform yourself!

I do not believe in any one system of exercise/fitness program that is a cure all. Movement whether it be bodybuilding or bodyweight is relevant to the human experience! Movement is life, all movement there is no one thing that will bring you complete freedom only the embodiment of all forms of movement will. We should be able to control ourselves to the very limits of the human body, whatever those limits are.

When we reach those limits we should then push to force those limits to give way to even greater capacity! The Men of Renown were said to have accomplished great feats of strength and ability! Together we will become The Men/Women of Renown join us as we transform the world!
