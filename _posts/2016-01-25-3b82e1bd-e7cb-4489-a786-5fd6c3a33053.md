What you will learn- 

Mobility: Functional Range Conditioning uses tension and isometrics to minimize neurological safeguards that inhibit mobility in the first place.  **It is designed to progressively convince the brain to release its protective stronghold on tissues at the cellular level. **The better your joints work the better you move.

Strength: Various tools will be used to increase joint strength in positions from hanging to floor movements that promote muscle and tendon growth. **Incremental loads imparted on any human tissue result in adaption of said tissue such that the load absorption capacity improves (Principle of Progressive Adaptation)**.

Balance: to increase one's spatial perception in regard to your present environment. enabling one to relate to a changing environment creating more neural pathways that stimulate the mind body connection. 

Mobilize life! Your body your rules transform yourself!

I do not believe in any one system of exercise/fitness program that is a cure all, movement whether it be olympic lifting or gymnastics is relevant to the human experience! Movement is life, all movement, there  is no one thing that will bring you complete freedom only the embodiment of all forms of movement will. We should be able to control ourselves to the very limits of the human body, whatever those limits are.
