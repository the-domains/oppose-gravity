title: "Being outside in nature is always a great feeling. The trees, birds, bugs, and people going on about their business its interesting to observe life. Breathing fresh air and enjoying the sun, always a great experience. Now if only I could hang my gymnastic rings on a tree, if your in Bangkok you'll know exactly what I mean. #frontlever #nature #movementculture #gymnastics #igfitness #healthylife #calisthenicsworldwide #opposegravity"
