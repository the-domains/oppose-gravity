title: 'Movement Foundations morning classes starting June Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 8-9am. @traininggroundbangkok Movement Foundations is a break from more traditional weight and bodyweight training programs. As it is designed to improve joint health and mobility then strength. Most injuries occur at or near the joint where the load exceeds the joints and their surrounding tissues capacity to resist. Joints, tendons, and ligaments take on average around 10 months to fully heal. With that being said it makes sense to strengthen the weakest links in the chain! Stronger connective tissue leads to stronger lifts. Increased range of motion leads to joint health and stability. As we age things begin to slow down, taking action now will improve your level of comfort as we approach our later years. Look around you many of your friends and family have severe mobility issues. How do you want to feel at 40 or 70 etc. walking with a Cane in constant pain or upright under your own control with freedom of movement? This 8week program will consist of a structured set of movements that enables beginners and advanced practitioners to move progressively towards better mobility as well as strength developed using your bodies own weight. mobility noun 1. the quality of being mobile. Movement is life! #bangkok #thailand #traininggroundbkk #movementculture #fitness #gymnastics #bodyweight #mobility'
