  I've noticed a lot of people doing the meal prep thing. Cooking a large amount
  of food then storing it for later. The funny thing about that is when your
  eating the same foods all week your missing vitamins and minerals your body
  needs. It may make your day easier but are you actually helping yourself in
  the long run. Eating a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, meats, seeds, etc.
  Allows the body to get a wide variety of vitamins and minerals your body needs
  to function at its peak performance level. Yes it's not time efficient but
  that's a price we should be willing to pay. What's more important?
