The last day of Movement Camp 2016 and I must say I don't have time to rest, when I return to my regular life with so much information it's time to consume this data translate it into something I can understand and then put it to use. I'm grateful for this opportunity and health that's allowed me to make it this far in my journey. Im excited to see where I'm going, self discovery is the greatest most interesting journey I've ever partaken. I'd advise everyone to take a dip within. Finally back in Bangkok! @portal.ido @odeliagold @sloblack Jon, Dudi, and Martin thank you all so much for an amazing experience I'll never forget (NEXT YEAR CANT WAIT)! #OpposeGravity #idoportal #idoportalmethod #movementculture #movementcamp2016 #Thailand #phuket #movement #movementislife</span></h3></a><div class="Attribution op-60 undefined" data-reactid="72"><h5 data-reactid="73"><span class="Author" data-reactid="74"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/opposegravity">opposegravity</a> / <a href="https://www.instagram.com">Instagram</a></span></h5></div><!-- react-empty: 75 --></div></div></div></section><section id="section-Video-f01b8a5b-241a-4518-8474-2e94d59bf50f" class="Section Section--components-1 title-size-small color-title section-bgcover-wo p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-center  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="76"><div class="Component p-1 " data-reactid="77"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1 m-a" data-reactid="78"><div class="Cover ov-h pos-r" data-reactid="79"><button class="color-bg color-title pos-a circle w-4rem h-4rem center-hv m-0 cur-p bx-sh-soft" data-reactid="80"><span class="center-hv pos-a w-1rem h-1rem" data-reactid="81"><svg version="1.1" id="Layer_1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="409.7 414 32.1 34.5" enable-background="new 409.7 414 32.1 34.5" xml:space="preserve"><polygon class="color-icon-pop" fill="#fff" points="418.6,448.5 441.8,431.3 418.6,414 "/></svg></span></button><img class="cur-p" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/0e498b6124ce1f5f5f06e0adbf7f9fc3/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F2bd2c6fe9a64001034f8cfebe96c6d0acd074f56.jpg&amp;width=640" style="object-position:65.234375% 76.328125%;" data-reactid="82"/></div></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 p-t-0" data-reactid="83"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/9IB8G6Gh3x/?taken-by=opposegravity" class=" " data-reactid="84"><!-- react-empty: 85 --><!-- react-empty: 86 --></a><!-- react-empty: 87 --><div class="max-w-560px m-a" data-reactid="88"><!-- react-text: 89 --> <!-- /react-text --><!-- react-empty: 90 --><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/9IB8G6Gh3x/?taken-by=opposegravity" class=" " data-reactid="91"><h3 class="m-t-1 m-b-1 font-title undefined" data-reactid="92"><span data-reactid="93">Joints are normally forgotten about when it comes to training programs.

I'm also placing FRC at the forefront of my training as there are too many benefits to ignore. #OpposeGravity #frc #pailsandrails #movementculture #humanmovement #movers #gymnastics #calisthenics","keywords":[],"authors":[{"name":"opposegravity","url":"https://www.instagram.com/opposegravity","avatar":{}}],"publisher":{"url":"https://www.instagram.com","name":"Instagram","favicon":"https://instagramstatic-a.akamaihd.net/h1/images/ico/favicon.ico/7cdab0872b15.ico","domain":"www.instagram.com"}},"cover":{"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/3664ce4d4fb8ebd188d6cebe07e31cb4/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F59fcf8e07f392fbc212c0997c71a7400a8f18ad5.jpg&width=640","original":"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e15/12905019_981804168570223_1316757832_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTIzMzAyNDkzMzI1ODk5Mjg5NQ%3D%3D.2","imgflosrc":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/59fcf8e07f392fbc212c0997c71a7400a8f18ad5.jpg","pictureImgfloUrls":[{"width":1440,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/3664ce4d4fb8ebd188d6cebe07e31cb4/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F59fcf8e07f392fbc212c0997c71a7400a8f18ad5.jpg&width=640"},{"width":1280,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/3664ce4d4fb8ebd188d6cebe07e31cb4/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F59fcf8e07f392fbc212c0997c71a7400a8f18ad5.jpg&width=640"},{"width":720,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/3664ce4d4fb8ebd188d6cebe07e31cb4/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F59fcf8e07f392fbc212c0997c71a7400a8f18ad5.jpg&width=640"},{"width":360,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/5a86577d9bf30504f0f83f2635ce53ea/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F59fcf8e07f392fbc212c0997c71a7400a8f18ad5.jpg&width=360"}],"ratio":"16:9","aspect":1.7777777777777777,"orientation":"landscape","width":640,"height":360,"rotation":0,"animated":false,"colors":[[222,207,186],[3,2,0],[179,145,108],[148,116,77],[84,71,55]],"saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[202,91],[524,244]],"confidence":0.617566,"center":[362,190],"radius":165.366},"exif":{}}}]},"e7148508-47fd-4944-b1fc-8bf4af4a84c4":{"id":"e7148508-47fd-4944-b1fc-8bf4af4a84c4","index":2,"created_by":"763c6f58-180d-4a5b-bf66-09ac921b0e2c","updated_by":null,"created_at":"2016-04-19T09:15:46.053Z","updated_at":null,"published":true,"score":0,"path":"_posts/2016-04-19-after-a-month-long-trip-to-the-states-i-happy-to-be-back-in.md","_title":"After a month long trip to the states I happy to be back in #bangkok @traininggroundbangkok Classes are Monday, Wednesday, & Fridays @7pm.
