            <title><![CDATA[German hangs are becoming very good friends of mines. Rusty shoulders are starting to move again. This move when I first tried felt like pure unadulterated torture. Really unbearable I could only touch and go and even then it felt like my shoulders were going to rip at the sockets. Over time all of this has disappeared my right rotator cuff feels great. I really cannot put my shoulder in a position where I can feel any pain of discomfort from my old injuries. More FREEDOM more movement... #opposegravity #traininggroundbkk #movementculture #mobilitywod #shouldermobility #calisthenics #gymnastics #sukhumvit69 #phrakhanong #gymlife #backlever]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[Weighted Chin Up Pyramid]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Weighted Chin Up Pyramid</h1><p>If you're looking to add some strength to your back and pulling muscles weighted chin-ups are a great addition to your training regimen. Why you might be asking? The reason is simple if you can chin-up more than your bodyweight your static movements like body levers and dynamic movements like muscle ups will become much easier to preform.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e3c2a1ef104297d4367f3aa4f390a608cb9d8541.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Last nights class was a success. Here's some assisted front and back lever cueing. Helping clients understand the difference of tension between both moves and how that tension changes as they transition from front to back! It's interesting to see people's strengths most of are unsure of what they can really do and are surprised when they exceed expectations! Just try it you may be pleasantly surprised yourself! If you fail so what you know exactly where you are and what it will take to get there! #OpposeGravity #Bangkok #Thailand #movementculture #movement #igfitness #calisthenics #gymnastics #thailandmovementcollective #traininggroundbkk #frontlever #backlever Movement Foundations Monday/Wednesday/Friday, @Training Ground 7pm Starting Jan 11 2016 Personal training available, contact for rates!

            <title><![CDATA[Just realized Instagram went to a full min. Anyway this is a clip of some of the things that I've been working on in the past month. It's great to push your boundaries to a new level to see yourself making progress. A lot of exciting things have happened and I'm sure more is following. Movement is growing in #Thailand and it's a great thing to be a part of that process. I'm also placing FRC at the forefront of my training as there are too many benefits to ignore. #OpposeGravity #frc #pailsandrails #movementculture #humanmovement #movers #gymnastics #calisthenics]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[Over the last two months from Dr. Andreo Spina & Dewey Nielsen's FRC workshop to Ido Portal's Movement Camp it's been a very interesting learning experience that's taken me across the world and several US states lol, I'm exhausted! The last day of Movement Camp 2016 and I must say I don't have time to rest, when I return to my regular life with so much information it's time to consume this data translate it into something I can understand and then put it to use. I'm grateful for this opportunity and health that's allowed me to make it this far in my journey. Im excited to see where I'm going, self discovery is the greatest most interesting journey I've ever partaken. I'd advise everyone to take a dip within. Finally back in Bangkok! @portal.ido @odeliagold @sloblack Jon, Dudi, and Martin thank you all so much for an amazing experience I'll never forget (NEXT YEAR CANT WAIT)! #OpposeGravity #idoportal #idoportalmethod #movementculture #movementcamp2016 #Thailand #phuket #movement #movementislife]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[Joints are normally forgotten about when it comes to training programs. If you're like me then you've injured something at some point in your life. Having strong joints will allow us to level up when it applies to training. That means stronger pulling, pushing, deeper ranges of motion, more stability, and some accident coverage from life's daily spills lol! #OpposeGravity #Bangkok #Thailand #calisthenics #gymnasticbodies #movementculture #movementpuzzle #jointhealth #mobility]]></title>
