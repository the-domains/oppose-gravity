            <title><![CDATA[Joints are normally forgotten about when it comes to training programs. If you're like me then you've injured something at some point in your life. Having strong joints will allow us to level up when it applies to training. That means stronger pulling, pushing, deeper ranges of motion, more stability, and some accident coverage from life's daily spills lol! #OpposeGravity #Bangkok #Thailand #calisthenics #gymnasticbodies #movementculture #movementpuzzle #jointhealth #mobility]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[Mental note: Few more inches to a full extension. Lower back strength is key trying to keep my hips from breaking and lengthening my arms to extend my lats and shoulders. Trying to feel no separation between muscle groups everything is locked and squeezed under tension. Hollow body is a position of max tension! Will be playing around with this more often. #OpposeGravity #Bangkok #Thailand #calisthenics #gymnasticbodies #movementculture #movementpuzzle]]></title>
