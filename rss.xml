            <title><![CDATA[I've noticed a lot of people doing the meal prep thing. Cooking a large amount of food then storing it for later. The funny thing about that is when your eating the same foods all week your missing vitamins and minerals your body needs. It may make your day easier but are you actually helping yourself in the long run. Eating a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, meats, seeds, etc. Allows the body to get a wide variety of vitamins and minerals your body needs to function at its peak performance level. Yes it's not time efficient but that's a price we should be willing to pay. What's more important? #healthychoices #choices #foodporn #paleo #food]]></title>
