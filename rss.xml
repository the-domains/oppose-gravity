            <title><![CDATA[Just realized Instagram went to a full min. Anyway this is a clip of some of the things that I've been working on in the past month. It's great to push your boundaries to a new level to see yourself making progress. A lot of exciting things have happened and I'm sure more is following. Movement is growing in #Thailand and it's a great thing to be a part of that process. I'm also placing FRC at the forefront of my training as there are too many benefits to ignore. #OpposeGravity #frc #pailsandrails #movementculture #humanmovement #movers #gymnastics #calisthenics]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[Over the last two months from Dr. Andreo Spina & Dewey Nielsen's FRC workshop to Ido Portal's Movement Camp it's been a very interesting learning experience that's taken me across the world and several US states lol, I'm exhausted! The last day of Movement Camp 2016 and I must say I don't have time to rest, when I return to my regular life with so much information it's time to consume this data translate it into something I can understand and then put it to use. I'm grateful for this opportunity and health that's allowed me to make it this far in my journey. Im excited to see where I'm going, self discovery is the greatest most interesting journey I've ever partaken. I'd advise everyone to take a dip within. Finally back in Bangkok! @portal.ido @odeliagold @sloblack Jon, Dudi, and Martin thank you all so much for an amazing experience I'll never forget (NEXT YEAR CANT WAIT)! #OpposeGravity #idoportal #idoportalmethod #movementculture #movementcamp2016 #Thailand #phuket #movement #movementislife]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[Joints are normally forgotten about when it comes to training programs. If you're like me then you've injured something at some point in your life. Having strong joints will allow us to level up when it applies to training. That means stronger pulling, pushing, deeper ranges of motion, more stability, and some accident coverage from life's daily spills lol! #OpposeGravity #Bangkok #Thailand #calisthenics #gymnasticbodies #movementculture #movementpuzzle #jointhealth #mobility]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[Mental note: Few more inches to a full extension. Lower back strength is key trying to keep my hips from breaking and lengthening my arms to extend my lats and shoulders. Trying to feel no separation between muscle groups everything is locked and squeezed under tension. Hollow body is a position of max tension! Will be playing around with this more often. #OpposeGravity #Bangkok #Thailand #calisthenics #gymnasticbodies #movementculture #movementpuzzle]]></title>
