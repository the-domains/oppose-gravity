            <title><![CDATA[Really focusing on joint strength still a great deal of shoulder opening work to do. Still it's an amazing feeling to have the mobility to move at this range. I'm curious to know how I'll feel in a year or 10 years with continued play. How will it feel to have open shoulders and hips, a supple strong back, and flexible mobile joints is something I meditate on as of late. Moving well is very important to me I'm not getting any younger at 40. I watch the people around me and I notice we don't move very well. Most of us don't have good balance we're uncoordinated and stiff. Can barely bend over to tie our shoes and forget about squatting that's an act of war. Coming from the West to Asia was really the eye opener. I went to the Philippines back 2013 and watched a 90 plus year old sit in a full squat with ease. As a matter of fact she could sit on the floor like a child. Back home you'll be lucky if you can stand up at that age. In Asia they never forgot how to keep themselves mobile. It makes for a more comfortable life. So for me it's a conscious decision that make complete sense. Do I want to look like a 90 year old in the States or do I want to move like the 90 year old in the Philippines? Something to think about ü§î #opposegravity #movementismedicine #movementculture #jointhealth #mobility #calisthenics #gymnastics #igfitness #fitness #igfit]]></title>
