            <title><![CDATA[Really focusing on joint strength still a great deal of shoulder opening work to do. Still it's an amazing feeling to have the mobility to move at this range. I'm curious to know how I'll feel in a year or 10 years with continued play. How will it feel to have open shoulders and hips, a supple strong back, and flexible mobile joints is something I meditate on as of late. Moving well is very important to me I'm not getting any younger at 40. I watch the people around me and I notice we don't move very well. Most of us don't have good balance we're uncoordinated and stiff. Can barely bend over to tie our shoes and forget about squatting that's an act of war. Coming from the West to Asia was really the eye opener. I went to the Philippines back 2013 and watched a 90 plus year old sit in a full squat with ease. As a matter of fact she could sit on the floor like a child. Back home you'll be lucky if you can stand up at that age. In Asia they never forgot how to keep themselves mobile. It makes for a more comfortable life. So for me it's a conscious decision that make complete sense. Do I want to look like a 90 year old in the States or do I want to move like the 90 year old in the Philippines? Something to think about ü§î #opposegravity #movementismedicine #movementculture #jointhealth #mobility #calisthenics #gymnastics #igfitness #fitness #igfit]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[Working on a full range of motion using the box as a guide to help me track my body line. Added some weighed sets to see how my form changed. Hips are slightly pitched backwards when weight is added, work in progress. This will definitely improve my ring muscle ups from the bottom of the dip transition. #opposegravity #muscleup #dips #strengthtraining #gymnastics #calisthenics #movementculture #fitness #strength #igfitness]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[German hangs are becoming very good friends of mines. Rusty shoulders are starting to move again. This move when I first tried felt like pure unadulterated torture. Really unbearable I could only touch and go and even then it felt like my shoulders were going to rip at the sockets. Over time all of this has disappeared my right rotator cuff feels great. I really cannot put my shoulder in a position where I can feel any pain of discomfort from my old injuries.

            <title><![CDATA[Weighted Chin Up Pyramid]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Weighted Chin Up Pyramid</h1><p>If you're looking to add some strength to your back and pulling muscles weighted chin-ups are a great addition to your training regimen. Why you might be asking? The reason is simple if you can chin-up more than your bodyweight your static movements like body levers and dynamic movements like muscle ups will become much easier to preform.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e3c2a1ef104297d4367f3aa4f390a608cb9d8541.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Last nights class was a success. Here's some assisted front and back lever cueing. Helping clients understand the difference of tension between both moves and how that tension changes as they transition from front to back! It's interesting to see people's strengths most of are unsure of what they can really do and are surprised when they exceed expectations! Just try it you may be pleasantly surprised yourself! If you fail so what you know exactly where you are and what it will take to get there! #OpposeGravity #Bangkok #Thailand #movementculture #movement #igfitness #calisthenics #gymnastics #thailandmovementcollective #traininggroundbkk #frontlever #backlever Movement Foundations Monday/Wednesday/Friday, @Training Ground 7pm Starting Jan 11 2016 Personal training available, contact for rates!

            <title><![CDATA[Just realized Instagram went to a full min. Anyway this is a clip of some of the things that I've been working on in the past month. It's great to push your boundaries to a new level to see yourself making progress. A lot of exciting things have happened and I'm sure more is following. Movement is growing in #Thailand and it's a great thing to be a part of that process. I'm also placing FRC at the forefront of my training as there are too many benefits to ignore. #OpposeGravity #frc #pailsandrails #movementculture #humanmovement #movers #gymnastics #calisthenics]]></title>
