            <title><![CDATA[I've noticed a lot of people doing the meal prep thing. Cooking a large amount of food then storing it for later. The funny thing about that is when your eating the same foods all week your missing vitamins and minerals your body needs. It may make your day easier but are you actually helping yourself in the long run. Eating a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, meats, seeds, etc. Allows the body to get a wide variety of vitamins and minerals your body needs to function at its peak performance level. Yes it's not time efficient but that's a price we should be willing to pay. What's more important? #healthychoices #choices #foodporn #paleo #food]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[Playing around with some rings at the beach. Always refreshing to feel the breeze and smell the fresh air around a large body of water. Amazing how it can recharge the mind, body and spirit. Allowing the process to develop slowly is enjoyable as growth peaks around just about every corner. Things that were impossible a year ago are easily assessable now. Still looking forward to improved movement complexity and physical adaptation the future is bright if you open your eyes and see! #beach #movementculture #igfitness #gymnastics #fitness #thailand #kohsamet]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[Movement Foundations morning classes starting June Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 8-9am. @traininggroundbangkok Movement Foundations is a break from more traditional weight and bodyweight training programs. As it is designed to improve joint health and mobility then strength. Most injuries occur at or near the joint where the load exceeds the joints and their surrounding tissues capacity to resist. Joints, tendons, and ligaments take on average around 10 months to fully heal. With that being said it makes sense to strengthen the weakest links in the chain! Stronger connective tissue leads to stronger lifts. Increased range of motion leads to joint health and stability. As we age things begin to slow down, taking action now will improve your level of comfort as we approach our later years. Look around you many of your friends and family have severe mobility issues. How do you want to feel at 40 or 70 etc. walking with a Cane in constant pain or upright under your own control with freedom of movement? This 8week program will consist of a structured set of movements that enables beginners and advanced practitioners to move progressively towards better mobility as well as strength developed using your bodies own weight. mobility noun 1. the quality of being mobile. Movement is life! #bangkok #thailand #traininggroundbkk #movementculture #fitness #gymnastics #bodyweight #mobility]]></title>
